You can use this book to learn about power in general, or study and reflect deeply upon the ideas to truly understand people and the world you live in.Don’t judge people by their declared intentions, but the actual outcomes of their actions. People who claim to reject power due to moral values are often the true manipulators or are simply naïve.",
